### Project Objective
The objective of this project was to construct a cost-effective photobioreactor to grow microalgae for research and to produce valuable, lucrative, and sustainable bioproducts. 

## What are microalgae and why are they important?
Microalgae are microscopic, single-celled, photosynthetic organisms that can exist independently or in colonies. They are capable of producing valuable products. You may have heard of Bioastin, which is a product harvested from the Hawaiian-grown microalgae *Haematococcus pluvialis*. Another benefit is their ability to photosynthesize and remove atmospheric CO2; they are more efficient at this than plants!

For this project, I learned to handle microalgae by growing them on solid plate media. Working in a sterile environment under a laminar flow hood, I learned to transfer the microalgae from solid to liquid media, where they could grow significantly faster. The Du Lab, which I worked under, came up with a variety of creative uses for the microalgae.

## What is a bioreactor?
A photobioreactor is an enclosed, illuminated culture vessel that scientists use to produce biomass. And this biomass is often in the form of microalgae.

There are different systems of photobioreactors: closed systems have no contact with the outside environment, while open systems are exposed to the air. Open systems are obviously much larger but provide a less controlled environment, while closed systems allow for less volume but offer more control over growth factors.

## Building a Temperature Control System
All bioreactors require some form of temperature control to ensure the water is neither too hot or too cold, which could kill the culture. I used the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller in conjunction with Peltier coolers to generate heating and cooling. When a current runs through a Peltier cooler, one side gets hot and the other side gets cold. This allowed me to control the flow of heat from the bioreactor.

## Project outcomes
This project was *the* defining step in my decision to pursue computer science as a degree. Interestingly, the first coding language I learned was Arduino – a unique one, for sure. The power of that code made me realize the impact I could have as a researcher or programmer or software engineer. Furthermore, the project taught me how to address different problems and find solutions to them.
