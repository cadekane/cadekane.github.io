## What is Cyberpatriots?
Cyberpatriots is a cybersecurity education program for youth across the United States. Students compete in cybersecurity competitions that pertain to different concepts and security threats. The rounds take place online, with 8 hours allocated to attempt to solve the problems. 

I competed in the Cisco portion of the competition. This involved the use of a simulated network of routers, switches, and computers that I had to navigate and use the command line on in order to solve a problem. My role also involved taking a difficult test about a variety of cybersecurity concepts. The competitions were brutal and exhausting, but also forced me to learn a lot of different skills and concepts.

## Experience takeaways
This experience was my first introduction to cybersecurity and anything related to programming. It was my first time using the commandline, my first introduction to the Linux operating system. It was also my first time interacting with likeminded students who were also interested in computer science.
