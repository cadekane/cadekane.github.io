Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer and second most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Furthermore, its incidence and mortality rates demonstrate disparities across different racial/ethnic populations. 

This research project aims to identify and analyze biomarkers associated with CRC by analyzing publicly available datasets from sources like the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). It will also focus on the unique context of multiethnic health disparities in CRC.

Whole genome or exome sequencing data, as well as metabolomics data, will be used to comprehensively examine genetic and metabolic changes caused by CRC development. By integrating these multi-omics data, this project aims to gain a deeper understanding of differing molecular processes behind CRC in Native Hawaiian, African-American, Asian, and other ethnic populations.
