  <p>JavaScript is the most flexible programming language I have encountered.</p>

<p>I have worked in Java, Python, Linux, R, and Arduino, but none are quite able to capture the sense of freedom that can be achieved with JavaScript. I’ll write some code, think, “That won’t work,” then it works, then I am pleasantly surprised. Its flexible nature leads me to contend that JavaScript “understands” me better than most other languages. I would put it in my top two languages so far, alongside Python – another very intuitive language.</p>

<h2 id="the-quirks">The quirks</h2>

<p>Coming in as a newbie, I was surprised to learn that the syntax of JavaScript shares many deep similarities to Java, the strictest coding language I’ve used. The use of brackets and semicolons, the for loops, and if else statements. The slight differences that do exist, however, are what delineate the line between excruciating and exhilarating. Java is excruciating (in my humble opinion), while JavaScript is more intuitive, and liberating.</p>

<p>Just from our initial introduction, it’s clear that JavaScript is a gold standard for software engineering. I think its most powerful feature is that it makes things feel natural and easy. I can’t recall the number of times I’ve sat in front of my computer screen, staring at my Java code, and thought about how limiting it felt. The acrobatic capacities of JavaScript make me feel like I can <em>do things</em> without the need to bang my head against the wall.</p>

<h2 id="brain-athleticism">Brain athleticism?</h2>

<p>As a concept, I find “Athletic Software Engineering” to be a promising pedagogy. To become an athlete in any field, one must learn certain skills and practice them to the point that they are second nature. The same concept applies to software engineering.</p>

<p>The practice Workouts of the Day (WODs) are highly stressful and, at times, immobilizing. I would liken them to a pressure cooker for the brain, something that pushes in on your thoughts as you struggle to find the solution; at the end of it all you’re well done and, rather appropriately, you’ve learned more in ten minutes than what you’d learn in a one-hour lecture. I will say that I enjoy them when I know what I am doing, and detest them when I don’t. I personally am excited to see what levels of brain athleticism I can achieve by the end of ICS314.</p>
