  <p>What constitutes a “smart” question? In his essay, “How to ask questions the smart way,” Eric Raymond delineates the border between an effective question and an ineffective one.</p>

<p>The first step in asking a good question is a question itself – a pre-question, directed inward at you, the questioner. <em>Is this something I can figure out myself? Can I easily Google or ChatGPT it? Am I using the correct assumptions?</em>. The harsh nature of the forum is severely unkind to the unprepared; this step can save someone a lot of time and protect them from a slew of potential passive-aggressive answers.</p>

<p>If, however, you have thoroughly attacked your problem to no avail, online forums are an excellent place to find your solution. Raymond explores a variety of forums and ways to ask smart or not-smart questions. This is an essential skill for software developers to communicate their challenges and receive good solutions. One of these forums is StackOverflow.</p>

<p>StackOverflow is a centralized hub of inquisitive developers – each with many, <strong>many</strong> questions. I will scour this gamut of inquiries to find the best and worst questions of the bunch.</p>

<p><img src="../img/essays/smart-questions/question.jpg" width="500px" /></p>

<h2 id="a-smart-question">A smart question:</h2>

<h3 id="xcode---how-to-fix-nsunknownkeyexception-reason--this-class-is-not-key-value-coding-compliant-for-the-key-x-error">Xcode - How to fix ‘NSUnknownKeyException’, Reason: “… this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key X” error?</h3>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3088059/xcode-how-to-fix-nsunknownkeyexception-reason-this-class-is-not-key-val">smart question link</a></p>

<p>This question is concise and to the point. The header states the exact error as well as the code language used. This gives responders the immediate ability to assess the question. Furthermore, the content of the question provides the individual’s goal – to link a UILabel with an IBOutlet. They paste the exact code error, not a link, for readers to see. This tends to make readers more likely to respond with a solution. And they finish with a quick question of how to fix the error. The entire question body is only a few lines and is explicit.</p>

<p>The responses to this question reflect its effectiveness. The top response begins with a header itself – ”You may have a bad connection in your xib” – followed by a sequence of steps and images as a solution. There are many answers to the question, demonstrating how the questioner made it as easy as possible to provide a solution (there were no hoops the responders had to jump through)! Overall, this constitutes a “smart” question.</p>

<h2 id="a-not-smart-question">A… not smart question:</h2>

<h3 id="how-do-i-know-if-my-approach-to-code-is-good-or-bad">How do I know if my approach to code is good or bad?</h3>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41197484/how-do-i-know-if-my-approach-to-code-is-good-or-bad">not smart question link</a></p>

<p>This question is extremely vague. There is no specific problem provided – the asker simply wants to know if there is a better way to accomplish a particular task of counting primes to a million. They provide a link to their code, which demonstrates laziness and tends to result in a similar reaction. One response doesn’t discuss the individual’s code at all, but poses a few general questions that attempt to point them in the right direction. Another begins their response with “If I understood you correctly…” which indicates the lack of clarity in their question. This reduces the responder’s ability to help the questioner. Lastly, a cherry on top, the questioner’s grammar is not the best.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>This experience has taught me how important it is to pause and think before typing, especially when you are in the public sphere. The internet is a powerful tool and it is our responsibility to use it in a way that benefits ourselves and others – one of those ways is asking thoughtful, effective questions.</p>

<p>Ultimately, asking good questions is an ability that requires thoughtful practice. I have come to appreciate the importance of being clear and concise while framing a question, and the significance of structuring it in a way that elicits meaningful and informative responses. A good question is not just about obtaining the desired information, but also about creating an engaging and thought-provoking conversation that can help others who have similar questions. And it is not a choice but a responsibility for us young, emerging software developers to ask good questions.</p>
