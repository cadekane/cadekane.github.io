Coding standards are a set of guidelines, rules, and regulations that one should adhere to while writing a program. These can help ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of one’s code. By following coding standards, developers enhance the quality of their programs and make it easier for others to understand. Coding standards, such as naming conventions, indentation, and code organization, are an important foundation that the rest of program must depend on to be considered robust.

After using the ESLint coding standards along with IntelliJ, I have come to appreciate the rigorous benchmarks meticulously enforced each time you sit down to write a piece of code. These serve as a guiding light, ensuring that your code is not ambiguous or sloppy. The ESLint coding standards, in conjunction with the powerful features of IntelliJ, have elevated my understanding and practice of coding.

## Challenges of Swiftly Enforced Coding Standards

One of the issues I have personally encountered with the advent of ESLint (and now, Github Copilot) is the vast number of labels and suggestions that arise while writing my code. For instance, I will begin to write a function and IMMEDIATELY am bombarded by a list of errors. I haven’t even written any code yet! In this way, I would analogize ESLint to an overbearing mother.

I write a line of code and, before I can even gather my thoughts, RED UNDERLINE, ERROR, GET OUT OF BED, FIX YOUR CODE! Sometimes, I feel as though I need a break from this constant nagging voice that wants the best for me but needs to learn when to let me do my thing. And, at the end of the day, I *do* appreciate what ESLint does for me, and the green check mark makes it all okay.

## Conclusions

After completing these modules, I can confidently say that my perspective on the importance of adhering to strict coding standards has changed. From this experience, I have developed a deeper understanding and appreciation of consistent and structured coding practices. They are a necessity for efficient, effective programs.

This newfound knowledge has not only broadened my perspective but has also equipped me with the tools and techniques necessary to effectively contribute to the development and enhancement of high-quality software solutions.
