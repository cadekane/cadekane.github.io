  <h2 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>

<p>Artificial intelligence is a game changer in the field of education. Apart from the usual fears of its use for cheating on assignments, it is an invaluable tool for learning unfamiliar and daunting concepts, particularly in computer science and software engineering. I have mainly used ChatGPT in ICS314. I use it in many contexts and applications. For instance, to explain an example piece of code whose function I don’t understand. Or, to generate a piece of code with the functionality I want but don’t have the knowledge to implement. It is such a powerful tool because it not only provides the solution, but explains every part of it so there is no ambiguity in my understanding. That is what majorly differentiates it from other sites that provide solutions to coding problems, and is what makes it such a revolutionary tool for learning.</p>

<h2 id="ii-personal-experience-with-ai">II. Personal Experience with AI:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Experience WODs e.g. E18: I have used AI to explain pieces of code I did not understand. For instance, on</li>
  <li>In-class Practice WODs: I used ChatGPT sparingly, to analyze pieces of code I didn’t understand or new concepts that came up. For example, I asked it to explain React elements and how they correlate to raw html.</li>
  <li>In-class WODs: I rarely used ChatGPT because I understood there was a clear goal or underlying concept the WOD was prompting me to exercise. That specificity made it difficult for ChatGPT to provide the correct solution, and I instead relied on the TA practice WODs I used instead.</li>
  <li>Essays: I used ChatGPT to help me construct essays based on an outline that I made. This way, I was able to get my unique perspective across (as opposed to a general one from ChatGPT) but did not have to hassle as much with the syntax or wording of my explanations. I also use Notion AI to improve the flow or organization of chunks of my writing.</li>
  <li>Final project: I use ChatGPT all the time by asking it to create a piece of code based on a functionality I want; sometimes I will provide a piece of code as an example for it to build off of as well. For example, I wanted to implement a link that would take me to another page and use the name of the link as the parameter. ChatGPT provided me one solution that used history. However, I didn’t want to use history, so it provided me another solution that I liked, then implemented.</li>
  <li>Learning a concept / tutorial: I always use ChatGPT to learn concepts.</li>
  <li>Answering a question in class or in Discord: I’ve never done this.</li>
  <li>Asking or answering a smart-question: I’ve never done this.</li>
  <li>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: This often came in conjunction with asking ChatGPT to provide an explanation.</li>
  <li>Explaining code: I use ChatGPT all the time to explain code.</li>
  <li>Writing code: I use ChatGPT all the time to write code snippets for me. As I’ve stated before, it is also excellent at breaking down the code and explaining purpose of the different components to me.</li>
  <li>Documenting code: I don’t use ChatGPT to document code because I didn’t know it could do that? I usually copy code into Notion if I think it is important, or record it somewhere else.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance: I use functionality with ChatGPT all the time. It is excellent at finding small errors that are extremely difficult for me to spot.</li>
  <li>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed: N/A</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="iii-impact-on-learning-and-understanding">III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:</h2>
<p>AI has completely changed my learning experience. I find that it has improved my comprehension abilities because of its capacity to explain concepts in ways that I specify to it (e.g. simply). On the other hand, I do think it has likely inhibited some of my problem-solving abilities because I turn to it so quickly if there is an error in my code.</p>

<h2 id="iv-practical-applications">IV. Practical Applications:</h2>

<p>I know that AI has been implemented in healthcare to analyze images for diagnosing diseases such as cancer. AI is also implemented in a vast field of data analysis to look at large datasets and identify important factors, such as driver genes in cancer or the effectiveness of drugs. I am personally interested in these applications as a biology minor, and there is no doubt of the significance of this work.</p>

<h2 id="v-challenges-and-opportunities">V. Challenges and Opportunities:</h2>
<p>One of the challenges I’ve encountered using AI is the application of certain specialized frameworks. Underscore functions were not received well when I asked ChatGPT to implement them. Similarly, some React components were not well-known by ChatGPT. For the most part, however, it is an excellent tool to retrieve a solution to a problem you may spend hours on with no success.</p>

<h2 id="vi-comparative-analysis">VI. Comparative Analysis:</h2>
<p>Traditional teaching methods are still very important in learning, in my opinion. There are things AI is incapable of doing – such as relevant analogies or dumbed-down explanations –that traditional teachers can do. It’s easier to engage with a teacher. However, one advantage AI has over teachers is its seemingly limitless base of knowledge. Furthermore, many professors are just not that good at teaching. If AI explains a concept unsatisfactorily, the user can easily ask it to explain it in a different way and it will adapt immediately.</p>

<p>One facet of the traditional approach that trumps AI completely is the development of practical skills. It is not easy to retain a concept if you just copy-paste the AI’s code into your project. Even something as simple as typing out the code can be invaluable in developing one’s knowledge and abilities as a software engineer.</p>

<h2 id="vii-future-considerations">VII. Future Considerations:</h2>
<p>AI will continue to be a powerhouse in software engineering education (and all fields of education, for that matter). AI is already being used to generate artwork – and I think it could be an excellent tool to generate graphics that help students learn material more efficiently. This will allow more personalized learning for students who learn differently.</p>

<h2 id="viii-conclusion">VIII. Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I think AI is an excellent tool that should be used in most (if not all) computer science courses. One way it could be included in classes is through the use of more hands-on projects that challenge students in new ways with new concepts. It should be considered a useful tool, not a threat, to our education.</p>
